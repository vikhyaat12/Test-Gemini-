      excerpt: "The 3pm dip is physiology, not a lack of willpower. Here is what is actually happening.",
      body: "<p>Most people blame themselves for the mid-afternoon crash. In reality it is a predictable dip in your circadian rhythm, compounded by blood-sugar swings and the cognitive cost of a busy morning.</p><p>Understanding the mechanism is the first step to working with your body instead of against it. Small, well-timed rituals — hydration, a short walk, and purposefully-dosed support — move the needle far more than another coffee.</p><h3>The science behind the dip</h3><p>Your body runs on a roughly 24-hour cycle. Between 1pm and 3pm, your core temperature drops slightly, and alertness follows. This is not a sign of poor health — it is a feature of human biology.</p><p>Add a high-glycemic lunch to the mix, and you get a blood-sugar spike followed by a sharp drop. The result: that foggy, can't-focus feeling that arrives like clockwork.</p><h3>What actually helps</h3><ul><li><strong>Hydrate first</strong> — Dehydration alone accounts for significant cognitive fatigue.</li><li><strong>Move briefly</strong> — A 10-minute walk resets circulation and cortisol.</li><li><strong>Choose steady energy</strong> — Protein-rich snacks and considered supplementation outperform caffeine.</li><li><strong>Embrace the dip</strong> — Schedule creative work for your peak hours and administrative tasks for the valley.</li></ul><p>Care is a practice, and energy is one of its most rewarding returns.</p>",

The words that matter are sample size, control group, dose, and independence.</p><h2>What to look for</h2><p>When evaluating a supplement claim, ask these questions:</p><ol><li><strong>Sample size</strong> — Was the study conducted on 12 people or 1,200?</li><li><strong>Control group</strong> — Did it include a placebo comparison?</li><li><strong>Dose</strong> — Was the dose used in the study the same as what's in the product?</li><li><strong>Independence</strong> — Was the study funded by an unbiased third party?</li></ol><p>At Queens Care we start from a real need, formulate around a meaningful dose, and test independently for purity. This piece walks through the questions worth asking before any product earns a place on your shelf.</p>",

/**
 * File-based database with disk-only reads.
 *
 * FIX: The previous implementation used a module-level `inMemoryData` singleton
 * which caused stale-data bugs in Turbopack dev mode — different worker threads
 * could hold separate copies of the cache, so writes in one thread weren't visible
 * in another.
 *
 * This version always reads from disk (using fs.stat mtime for a cheap staleness
 * check) and writes through to disk synchronously. Every `get()` call returns
 * the latest persisted state. The DB file is ~30KB which reads in <1ms on SSD.
